<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Pesto Pasta is a delicious and easy-to-make dish that is perfect for a quick weeknight meal. The dish consists of pasta, pesto sauce, and a few other simple ingredients. To make this dish, you will need to cook the pasta and toss it with the pesto sauce. You can then add some Parmesan cheese and pine nuts for extra flavor and texture.</p>

    <li>1/2 cup pesto sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup pine nuts</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
