    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pesto Pasta is a delicious and easy-to-make dish that is perfect for a quick weeknight meal. The dish consists of pasta, pesto sauce, and a few other simple ingredients. To make this dish, you will need to cook the pasta and toss it with the pesto sauce. You can then add some Parmesan cheese and pine nuts for extra flavor and texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces pasta (spaghetti or any other type of pasta)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pesto sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup pine nuts</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta and reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li>Return the pasta to the pot and add the pesto sauce, Parmesan cheese, and pine nuts. Toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce. If the pasta seems dry, add some of the reserved pasta water to moisten it.</li>

        <li>Divide the pasta among plates and serve immediately.</li>
