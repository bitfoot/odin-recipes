    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is beloved by many for its comforting layers of pasta, meat, cheese, and tomato sauce. To make a delicious lasagna, you will need to start by gathering all the necessary ingredients, which typically include lasagna noodles, ground beef or sausage, marinara sauce, ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>24-ounce jar of marinara sauce</li>
        <li>15-ounce container of ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and chopped onion and sauté for a few minutes until the onion is translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the marinara sauce to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Let the sauce cook for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat this layering process, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
